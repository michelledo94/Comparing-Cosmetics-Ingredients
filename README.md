# Comparing-Cosmetics-Ingredients
Exploring ingredients of Sephora products with EDA, word embedding and T-SNE based on a guided project on DataCamp.

Implementation: 
1. EDA
2. Prep data for T-SNE modeling (tokenize ingredient lists and transform into a Document-Term Matrix)
3. Reduce dimension with T-SNE
4. Visualize with Bokeh and check model results (GitHub can't show interactive plots though)
